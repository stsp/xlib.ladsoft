XLIB is a simple librarian for the old DOS library format.  The basic
functionality is to read in the target library, if it exists, into a list
of its component object files.  Then object files are extracted, deleted,
and inserted as per commands on the command line.  Finally, the dictionary
is recalculated, and the library is written back to itself.


This is made up of the following files:

ALLOCATE.C  - memory allocation
ARGS.C      - argument parsing
DICT.C      - dictionary creation
ERROR.C     - error messages
EXT.C       - simple file extension handling
FATAL.C     - fatal error and exit
HASH.C      - hash tables for internal symbol names storage
IMPORT.C    - import declaration module
LIB.C       - library i/o utils
LIST.C      - list functions
MODULE.C    - object file reader
USAGE.C     - usage and banner functions
XLIB.C      - main line and command line parsing

the related .h and .p files declare various things that need to be
declared, and prototypes
