The browse compiler is an internal tool used to create browse information
for use with the IDE.  The browse information is initially created by the
CC386 compiler, and consists of symbol name and line number information.
BRC gets rid of duplicates and dumps the information to the browse file
linearly; then it creates a simple dictionary.  The dictionary is a tree
structure.  At the top level we have a list of all the first characters
encountered in each word of the source files.  Each first character points
to a list of second characters for that first character... each second
character likewise points to a list of third characters.  Eventually
the end of a word is reached and there is a pointer to the browse information
record associated with that word.
