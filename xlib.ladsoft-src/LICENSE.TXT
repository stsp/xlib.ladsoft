By installing and or using this software you agree to be bound by the
following licensing restrictions.

Copyrights for the dos extenders are held by the author of each extender.  When
choosing a dos extender to use in an application, you agree to be bound by the
author's original licensing.  The license for the default extender 'DOS32A' is
found in the file 'DOS32A.LIC'.  Check the author's install package for other
extenders to get the licensing terms.

The windows 32 header files are GNU GPL-d.  It is unclear what the impact of that
license is on header files, since there is little or no executable code involved,
but be prepared to deal with the full consequences of the GNU-GPL if you intend 
to use them.  See the file 'copying' for details.

The remainder of the runtime library is now BSD-licensed as outlined in the file
'bsd.lic'.  You agree to be bound by the BSD license if you distribute the 
library or parts of the library.

Copyrights for NASM are held by Simon Tatham and Julian Hall.  This seems to be
GNU-GPL based for the version of NASM I am distributing, but I have included 
their license file for reference in 'nasm.lic'.

The remainder of the applications are currently GNU-GPL licensed.  See the file
'copying' for details.
